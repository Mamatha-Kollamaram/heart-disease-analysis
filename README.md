![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue?logo=python)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pandas-1.3+-blue?logo=pandas)
![Seaborn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-0.11+-blue?logo=seaborn)

**Core Libraries:**
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- NumPy (Numerical computing)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
- SciPy (Statistical testing)

## Key Findings
**Strongest Predictors:**

- **Positive correlation**: `exercise_angina`, `st_depression`  
- **Negative correlation**: `max_heart_rate`, `st_slope`

**Regional Differences:**

-Cleveland patients had higher average cholesterol (p < 0.05)
-Hungarian patients showed more exercise-induced angina

**Risk Factors:**

-Patients with heart disease had significantly higher ST depression (p < 0.01)
-Males showed 2.3x higher disease prevalence


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-eda.git ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_eda.ipynb ```

## Dataset
This project uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, available at UCI Machine Learning Repository.

-Link: [Visit the UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
-Multiple sources in one file (e.g., Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach)
-Raw and less pre-cleaned â†’ ideal to showcase your data cleaning skills
-Real clinical values, providing authentic and challenging insights
-You can focus on a single hospital source (like Cleveland) or compare multiple for a unique perspective

## Results
- Visualizations such as histograms, count plots, and pair plots are included to help you understand the data better.

- Statistical analysis reveals significant relationships between different features and heart disease presence.
